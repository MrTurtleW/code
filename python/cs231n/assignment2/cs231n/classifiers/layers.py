class TwoLayerNet:
    """
    A two-layer fully-connected neural network with ReLU nonlinearity and
    softmax loss that uses a modular layer design. We assume an input dimension
    of D, a hidden dimension of H, and perform classification over C classes.

    The architecture should be affine - relu - affine - softmax.
